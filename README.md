Pre-requisite for the app : API key from https://www.themoviedb.org/ 

In order to run the application, kindly add the line in  
[user_home]/.gradle/gradle.properties file (create the file if it does not exist already):

MyTheMovieDbApiKey= ” \<YOUR_API_KEY\> ”

For example, lets assume your api key is "QWERTYUIOP", then:

MyTheMovieDbApiKey=”QWERTYUIOP”
